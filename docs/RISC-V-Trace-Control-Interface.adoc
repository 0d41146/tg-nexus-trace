== Introduction

This document presents a control interface for the Trace Encoder described in the _Efficient Trace for RISC-V Specification Version 2.0_ and for the RISC-V N-Trace specification (in progress). Both Trace Working Groups agreed to standardize the control interface so that trace control software development tools can be used interchangeably with any RISC-V device implementing processor and/or data trace.

Instruction Trace is a system that collects a history of processor execution, along with other events. The trace system may be set up and controlled using a register-based interface. Hart execution activity appears on the Ingress Port and feeds into a Trace Encoder where it is compressed and formatted into trace messages. The Trace Encoder transmits trace messages to a Trace Sink. In multi-core systems, each hart has its own Trace Encoder, and typically all will connect to a Trace Funnel that aggregates trace data from multiple sources and sends the data to a single destination.

This specification does not define the hardware interconnection between the hart and Trace Encoder, as this is defined in the _Efficient Trace for RISC-V Specification Version 2.0_. This document also does not define the hardware interconnection between the Trace Encoder and Trace Funnel, or between the Trace Encoder/Funnel and Trace Sink.

This specification allows a wide range of implementations including low-gate-count minimal instruction trace and systems with only instrumentation trace. Implementation choices include whether to support branch trace, data trace, instrumentation trace, timestamps, external triggers, various trace sink types, and various optimization tradeoffs between gate count, features, and bandwidth requirements.

== Glossary

*Trace Encoder* - Hardware module that accepts execution information from a hart and generates a stream of trace messages/packets.

*Trace Message/Packet* - Depending on protocol different names can be used, but it means the same. It is considered as continous sequence of (usully bytes) describing program and/or data flow.

*Trace Funnel* - Hardware module that combines trace streams from multiple Trace Encoders into a single output stream.

*Trace Sink* - Hardware module that accepts a stream of trace messages and records them in memory or forwards them onward in some format.

*Trace Decoder* - Software program that takes a recorded trace (from Trace Sink) and produces readable execution history.

*WARL* - Write any, read legal. If a non-legal value is written, the writen value must be ignored and register will keep previous, legal value. Used by debugger to determine system capabilities. See Discovery chapter.

*ATB* - Advanced Trace Bus, a protocol described in ARM document IHI0032B.

*PIB* - Pin Interface Block, a parallel or serial off-chip trace port feeding into a trace probe.

== Trace System Overview

This section briefly describes features of the Trace Encoder and other trace components as background for understanding some of the control interface register fields.

=== Trace Encoder Types

By monitoring the Ingress Port, the Trace Encoder determines when a program flow discontinuity has occurred and whether the discontinuity is inferable or non-inferable. An inferable discontinuity is one for which the Trace Decoder can statically determine the destination, such as a direct branch instruction in which the destination or offset is included in the opcode. Non-inferable discontinuities include all other types as interrupt, exception, and indirect jump instructions.

=== Branch Trace Messaging

Branch Trace Messaging is the simplest form of instruction trace. Each program counter discontinuity results in one trace message, either a Direct or Indirect Branch Message. Linear instructions (or sequences of linear instrucions) do not result in any trace messages/packets.

Indirect Branch Messages normally contain a compressed address to reduce bandwidth. The Trace Encoder emits a Branch With Sync Message containing the complete instruction address under certain conditions. This message type is a variant of the Direct or Indirect Branch Message and includes a full address and a field indicating the reason for the Sync.

=== Branch History Messaging

Both the Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace) Specification and the Nexus standard define systems of messages intended to improve compression by reporting only whether conditional branches are taken by encoding each branch outcome in single taken/not-taken bit. The destinations of non-inferable jumps and calls are reported as compressed addresses. Much better compression can be achieved, but an Encoder implementation will typically require more hardware.

=== Other Optimizations

Several other optimizations are possible to improve trace compression. These are optional for any Trace Encoder and there should be a way to disable optimizations in case the trace system is used with code that does not follow recommended API rules. Examples of optimizations are a Return-address stack, Branch repetition, Statically-inferable jump, and Branch prediction.

=== Trace Sinks

The Trace Encoder transmits completed messages to a Trace Sink. This specification defines a number of different sink types, all optional, and allows an implementation to define other sink types. A Trace Encoder must have at least one sink attached to it.

NOTE: Trace messages/packets are sequences of bytes. In case of wider sink width, some padding/idle bytes (or additioanl formatting) may be added by particular sink. Nexus format allows any number of idle bytes between messages.

==== SRAM Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words (usually bytes). These are then stored in a dedicated RAM, typically located on-chip, in a circular-buffer fashion. When the RAM has filled, it may optionally be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace.

==== PIB Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to the PIB Sink. Each message is transmitted off-chip (as sequence of bytes) using a specific protocol described later.

==== System Bus (SBA) Memory Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words. These are then stored in a range of system memory reserved for trace using a DMA-type bus master in a circular-buffer fashion. When the memory range has been filled, it may optionally be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace. This type of sink may also be used to transmit trace off-chip through, for example, a PCIe or USB port.

==== Funnel Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to a Trace Funnel. The Funnel aggregates trace from each of its inputs and sends the combined trace stream to its designated Trace Sink, which is one or more of the sink types above.

NOTE: It is assumed, that each input to funnel (trace encoder or another funnel) has unique message source ID defined (this is 'trTeSrcID' field in trTeControl register).

==== ATB Bridge

The ATB Bridge transmits bytes of RISC-V trace messages as an ATB bus master.

ATB has width, which is either 8 or 32-bit what will well match 'packet=sequence-of-bytes' definition.

== Control Interface

The Trace Control interface consists of a set of 32-bit registers. The control interface can be used to set up and control a trace session, retrieve collected trace, and control any trace system components.

=== Trace Components

This specification defines the following trace components:

.*Trace Components*
[cols="15%,28%,18%,~",options="header",]
|===
|*Component Name* |*Component Type (value=symbol)*|*Base Address (symbol)* |*Description*
|Trace Encoder |0x1=TRCOMP_ENCODER|trBaseEncoder|Accepts execution information from a hart (via Trace Ingress Port) and generates a stream of RISC-V trace messages/packets.
|Trace Funnel |0x8=TRCOMP_FUNNEL|trBaseFunnel|Acccepts several RISC-V trace message/packet streams (from  multiple Trace Encoder[s] or Trace Funnel[s]) and merges them into single stream of trace messages/packets.
|Trace RAM Sink |0x9=TRCOMP_RAMSINK|trBaseRamSink|Accepts RISC-V trace messages/packets (from Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel) and stores them into RAM buffer (either dedicated SRAM or System Bus).
|Trace PIB Sink |0xA=TRCOMP_PIBSINK|trBasePibSink|Accepts RISC-V trace messages/packets (from Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel) and sends them via set of pins (parallel or serial).
|Trace ATB Bridge |0xE=TRCOMP_ATBBRIDGE|trBaseAtbBridge|Accepts RISC-V trace messages/packets (from Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel) and forwards them to ATB bus in a system.
|===

NOTE: This specification is NOT addressing discovery of base addresses of trace components. These base addresses (trBase... symbols in above table) must be specified as part of trace tool configuration. Connections between different trace components must be also defined. Future version of this specification may allow single base address to be sufficient to access all components in the system.

Each Trace Component is controlled by set of 32-bit registers occupying up to a 4K-byte space. Base address of each trace component must be aligned on 4K boundary.

Each hart being traced must have its own separate Trace Encoder control component. This also applies to multiple harts that belong to the same core. A system with multiple harts must allow generating messages with a field indicating which hart is responsible for that message.

==== Connections Between Components

Different components must be connected via internal busses and/or FIFO buffers. This specification does not define this interconnect logic, but the following rules must be followed:

* Each component sending a trace message/packet must assure the entire packet can be accepted by the destination component (or pushed into the FIFO buffer).
** Sending a partial packet is NEVER allowed as it will not be possible to process such a trace.
* If a component cannot send an entire message/packet it must wait until it will be possible to do so.
** Trace Encoder may either stall the hart and finally resume execution after sending a packet which caused the stall.
* In case a stall of the hart is not possible (or is not configured ...), Trace Encoder must drop the packet and wait for the receiver to be ready.
** Once trace is allowed to resume it must issue a synchronization packet so the decoder will be aware that some (unknown) amount of trace has been lost.
** Best idea is to wait for complete drain of the trace pipeline before resuming - otherwise a lot of short chunks of trace may be produced.
* Easiest way to prevent trace overflows is to assure FIFO capable of holding several trace messages/packets is placed AFTER Trace Encoder and/or use wider internal busses to provide more bandwidth.

.*Allowed Connections Between Components*
[cols="20%,20%,~",options="header",]
|===
|*Input* |*Output* |*Description*
|Ingress Port|Trace Encoder|Ingress Port (from hart) providing raw trace trace to be encoded

|Trace Encoder|Trace RAM Sink|Single hart tracing to RAM buffer
|Trace Encoder|Trace PIB Sink|Single hart tracing via pins
|Trace Encoder|Trace ATB Bridge|Single hart tracing to Arm ATB infrastructure
|Trace Encoder|Trace Funnel|Sending trace from single hart to Trace Funnel (to be combined from other RISC-V trace)

|Trace Funnel|Trace Funnel|Sending combined trace from multiple harts to higher level Trace Funnel (to be combined from other RISC-V trace)
|Trace Funnel|Trace RAM Sink|Sending combined trace from multiple harts to RAM buffer
|Trace Funnel|Trace PIB Sink|Sending combined trace from multiple harts via pins
|Trace Funnel|Trace ATB Bridge|Sending combined trace from multiple harts to Arm ATB infrastructure

|Trace ATB Bridge |Arm ATB bus|Sending trace to ATB (to combine RISC-V trace with other Arm components on the system)
|===

NOTE: Sending to Arm ATB infrastructure is allowed (via ATB Bridge), but this specification does not specify how to transport trace data from (possible ...) Arm components in the system using RISC-V Trace sub-system.
One of possible ways of doing so would be to create a custom trace component, configure it to encapsulate it as custom Nexus trace messages and connect it as input to one of trace funnels.

=== Accessing Trace Control Registers

For the access method to the trace control registers, it makes a difference whether these registers shall be accessed by an external debug/trace tool, or by an internal debugger running on the chip.

Trace control register access by an external debugger (this is the most common use case):

* External debuggers must be able to access all trace control registers independent of whether the traced harts are running or halted. That is why for external debuggers, the recommended access method for memory-mapped control registers is memory accesses through the RISC-V debug module using SBA (System Bus Access) as defined in the RISC-V Debug Specification.

Trace control register access by an internal debugger:

* Through loads and stores performed by one or more harts in the system. Mapping the control interface into physical memory accessible from a hart allows that hart to manage a trace session independently from an external debugger. A hart may act as an internal debugger or may act in cooperation with an external debugger. Two possible use models are collecting crash information in the field and modifying trace collection parameters during execution. If a system has physical memory protection (PMP), a range can be configured to restrict access to the trace system from hart(s).

NOTE: Additional control path(s) may also be implemented, such as extra JTAG registers or devices, a dedicated DMI debug bus or message-passing network. Such an access (which is NOT based on System Bus) may require custom implementation by trace probe vendors as this specification only mandates probe vendors to provide access via SBA commands.

=== Trace Component Register Map

Each  block of 32-bit registers (for each component) has the following layout:

.*Register Layout for Component*
[cols="10%,25%,15%,~",options="header",]
|===
|*Address Offset* |*Register Name* |*Compliance* |*Description*
|0x000 |tr??Control |Required |Main control register for this trace component
|0x004 |tr??Impl |Required |Trace Implementation information for this trace component
|0x008 |tr??Control2 |Optional |Additional controls for this trace component (can be named differently)
|0x00C |tr??Control3 |Optional |Additional controls for this trace component (can be named differently)
|0x010 - 0xDFF |-- |Optional |Additional registers (specific for particular type of component). All not used registers are reserved and should read as 0 and ignore writes.
|0xE00 - 0xFFF |-- |Optional |Registers reserved for implementation specific details. May allow identification of components on a system bus.
|===

WARNING: Each component has 'tr??Active' bit in 'tr??Control' register. Accesses to other registers are unpredictable when 'tr??Active' bit is 0. 

Each trace component has tr??Impl register (at address offset 0x4) where trace component version and trace component type can be identified. This register allows debug tool to verify provided component base address and potentially adjust tool behaviour by looking at component version.

NOTE: Each component may have different version. Initial version of this specificiation define all components to specify component version as 1.0 (major=1, minor=0).

Registers in the 4K range that are not implemented are reserved and read as 0 and ignore writes.

Most of trace control registers are optional. Some WARL fields may be hard-coded to any value (including 0). It allows different implementations to provide different functionality.

Both N-Trace and E-Trace encoders are controlled by the same set of bits/fields in same registers. As almost every register/field/bit is optional this provides good flexibility in implementation.

== Versioning of Components

Each component has a tr??Impl register, which includes two 4-bit 'tr??VerMinor' and 'tr??VerMajor' fields. These fields are guaranteed to be present in all future revisions of a standard, so trace tools will be able to discover a component version and act accordingly.

* Values 0 as 'tr??VerMajor' is NOT allowed (due to compatibility reasons).
* Different components may report different versions (as some components may be updated more often than others).
* The major version 'tr??VerMajor' field should change, when some incompatible (which will break older trace software ...) change is introduced.
* The minor version 'tr??VerMinor' field should change, when change is considered a compatible extension (for example adding a new field) - from that reason software should always write 0 to undefined bits in registers. 
* Version 15.x is reserved for non-compatible version encoding.
* Version n.15 should be used as experimental (in development) implementation.

Versions should be always reported as two decimal numbers __'major.minor'__ - initial version of this specification is *__1.0__*.

Trace software should handle versions as follows (let's assume hypothetical version 2.3 was defined as current version in moment of release of trace software)

* 0.x => Reject as not supported or generate a warning and handle as legacy version 0.
* 2.3 => Accept silently.
* 2.2 => Accept silently (and trim features or not allow user to set newer features).
* 2.4 => Generate a warning but continue using 2.3 features.
* 2.15 => Generate an "experimental version" warning but continue using 2.3 features.
* 1.x => Generate a warning and continue or reject as an obsolete (referring to last debugger supporting this version).
* 3.x => Abort with an error that this future version is not compatible with existing software and possibly redirect to the tool update page.

NOTE: Displayed messages should report component name, component base address and current and supported version numbers. It is suggested to display the full hexadecimal value of 'tr??Impl' register as it may aid in debugging of possibly incorrect/incompatible component configuration.

== Trace Encoder Control Interface

Many features of the Trace Encoder are optional. In most cases, optional features are enabled using a WARL (write any, read legal) register field. A debugger can determine if an optional feature is present by writing to the register field and reading back the result.

== Timestamp Unit

Timestamp Unit is an optional sub-component present in either Trace Encode or Trace Funnel. An implementation may choose from several types of timestamp units: 

* *Internal System* - fixed clock in a system (such as bus clock) is used to increment the timestamp counter
* *Internal Core* - core clock is used to increment the timestamp counter (only applicable to Trace Encoders)
* *Shared* - shares timestamp with another Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel
* *External* - accepts a binary timestamp value from an outside source such as ARM CoreSight(TM) trace

Implementations may have no timestamp, one timestamp type, or more than one type. The WARL field trTsType is used to determine the system capability and to set the desired type.

The width of the timestamp is implementation-dependent, typically 40 or 48 bits (40 bit timestamp will overflow every 4.7 minutes assuming 1GHz timestamp clock).

In a system with Funnels, typically all the Funnels are built with a Timestamp Unit. The top-level Funnel is the source of the timestamp (Internal System or External) and all the Encoders and other Funnels have Shared timestamp. To perform the forwarding function, the mid-level Funnels must be programmed with trFunnelActive=1 (which is natural as all trace messages must pass through that funnel).

An Internal Timestamp Unit may include a prescale divider, which can extend the range of a narrower timestamp and uses less power but has less resolution.

In a system with an Internal Core timestamp counter (implemented in Trace Encoder associated with a hart), it may be desirable to stop the counter when the hart is halted by a debugger. An optional control bit is provided for this purpose, but it may or may not be implemented.

== Trace Encoder Triggers

=== Debug Module Triggers

Debug triggers are signals from the hart that a trigger (breakpoint or watchpoint) was hit, but the action associated with that trigger is a trace-related action. Action identifiers 2-5 are reserved for trace actions in the RISC-V Debug Spec, where triggers are defined. Actions 2-4 are defined by the Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace) Specification. The desired action is written to the action field of the Match Control mcontrol CSR (0x7a1). Not all harts support trace actions; the debugger should read back mcontrol CSR after setting one of these actions to verify that the option exists.

.*Debug Trigger Actions*
[cols="15%,~",options="header",align=center,width=80%]
|===
|*Action (from debug spec)* |*Effect*
|0 |Breakpoint exception
|1 |Debug exception
|2 |*Trace-on action*

When trTeInstTrigEnable=1 it will start instruction tracing (trTeInstTracing -> 1).

When trTeDataTrigEnable=1 it will start data tracing (trTeDataTracing -> 1). 
|3 |*Trace-off action*

When trTeInstTrigEnable=1 it will stop instruction tracing (trTeInstTracing -> 0).

When trTeDataTrigEnable=1 it will stop data tracing (trTeDataTracing -> 0). 
|4 |*Trace-notify action*

It will cause encoder to generate packet with current PC (and possibly timestamp).

If trace is not active (trTeInstTracing = 0) it should be ignored.
|5 |*Vendor-specific action* (optional)
|===

If there are vendor-specific features that require control, the trTeTrigDbgControl register is used.

=== External Triggers

The TE may be configured with up to 8 external trigger inputs for controlling trace. These are in addition to the external triggers present in the Debug Module when Halt Groups are implemented. The specific hardware signals comprising an external trigger are implementation-dependent.

External Trigger Outputs may also be present. A trigger out may be generated by trace starting, trace stopping, a watchpoint, or by other system-specific events.

=== Triggers Precedence

It is implementation-dependent what happens when debug triggers or external triggers with conflicting actions occur simultaneously or if debug triggers or external triggers occur too frequently to process.

== Trace Encoder Filter Registers

All registers with offsets 0x400 .. 0x7FC are reserved for additional trace encoder filtering options (context, addresses, modes etc.).

Specifications for different trace encoders should define registers in this range.

*N-Trace:*    Only Debug Trigger based filtering is defined in this version.

*E-Trace:*    Additional trace filtering as defined by register map defined below. Provision is made for upto 16 filters and 8 comparators, indexed by _i_ and _j_ respectively (_i_ is in the range 0 - 15; _j_ is in the range 0 - 7).

== Trace RAM Sink

Trace RAM Sink may be instantiated or configured to support storing trace into dedicated SRAM or system memory. SRAM mode is using dedicated memory, while system memory mode is accessign memory via system bus (care should be taken to not overwrite application code or data - it is usually done by reserving part of system memory for trace). Dedicated SRAM memory must be read via dedicated 'trRamData' register, while memory in SBA (System Bus Access) mode should be read as any other memory on system bus.

Trace data is placed in memory in LSB order (first byte of trace packet/data is placed on LSB). For N-trace packets, MSEO bits are placed on LSB bits of each byte.

Be aware that in case trace memory wraps around some protocols may require additional synchronization data - it is usually done by periodically generating sequence of bytes which cannot be part of any valid packet. N-Trace protocol does not require it as it is self-synchronizing - last byte of each message/packet is specially marked.

NOTE: When trace capture was wrapped around (trRamWrap=1) beginning of trace is not available and oldest packets/messages in trace buffer (starting at 'trRamWP') will be most likely not complete. Trace decoder must look for start of message. Also when trace is stopped on wrap aroud, last message recorded in trace memory may not be complete.   

Implementations when trace buffer in system memory will be bigger than 4GB is desired will be unlikely. 

NOTE: FUTURE: Add 64-bit extensions as 32 MSB bits of size (reading 3 times is needed to be certain about 64-bit value). In order to relieve trace software to always read 3 times, there should be a field/bit saying if RAM size over 32-bit is implemented. It may be also WARL field, which must be set to '1' in order to allow 64-bit size. In most cases, it will never be settable (as 4GB of RAM for trace is rare requirement)

Table below shows typical Trace RAM Sink configurations. Implementing other configurations if not suggested as trace tools may not support it without adjustments.

== Trace PIB Sink

Trace data may be sent to chip pins through an interface called the Pin Interface Block (PIB). This interface typically operates at a few hundred MHz and can sometimes be higher with careful constraints and board layout or by using LVDS or other high-speed signal protocol. PIB may consist of just one signal and in this configuration may be called SWT (Serial-Wire Trace). Alternative configurations include a trace clock clock (TRC_CLK) and  1/2/4/8/16 parallel trace data signals (TRC_DATA) timed to that trace clock. WARL register fields are used to determine specific PIB capabilities.

The modes and behavior described here are intended to be compatible with trace probes available in the market.

|===

Since the PIB supports many different modes, it is necessary to follow a particular programming sequence:

* Activate the PIB by setting trPibActive.
* Set the trPibMode, trPibDivider, trPibClkCenter, and trPibCalibrate fields. This will set the TRC_DATA outputs to the quiescent state (whether that is high or low depends on trPibMode) and start TRC_CLK running.
* Activate the receiving device, such as a trace probe.  Allow time for PLL to sync up, if using a PLL with a parallel PIB mode.
* Set trPibEnable.  This enables the PIB to generate output either immediately (calibration mode) or when the trace encoder or funnel begins sending trace messages.

Order of bits and bytes:

* Trace messages/packets are considered as sequence of bytes and are always transmitted with LSB bits/bytes first.
* Nexus MSEO bits are transmitted on LSB part and bit#0 first.
* Idle state must be transmitted as all MSEO and MDO bits = 1.
* In 16-bit mode first byte of message is transmitted on LSB part and MSEO of second/odd byte will be transmitted on bits #8-#9 and MDO on bits #10-#15.

NOTE: Above rules allow receiving probe to skip idle messages.

=== Calibration Mode

In optional calibration mode, the PIB transmits a repeating pattern. Probes can use this to automatically tune input delays due to skew on different PIB signal lines and to adjust to the transmitter's data rate (trPibControl.trPibDivider and trPibControl.trPibClkCenter). Calibration patterns for each mode are listed here.

=== SWT Manchester Protocol

In this mode, the PIB outputs complete trace messages encapsulated between a start bit and a stop bit. Each bit period is divided into 2 phases and the sequential values of the TRC_DATA[0] pin during those 2 phases denote the bit value. Bits of the message are transmitted LSB first. The idle state of TRC_DATA[0] is low in this mode.

=== SWT UART Protocol

In UART protocol, the PIB outputs bytes of a trace message encapsulated in a 10-bit packet consisting of a low start bit, 8 data bits, LSB first, and a high stop bit. Another packet may begin immediately following the stop bit or there may be an idle period between packets. When no data is being sent, TRC_DATA[0] is high in this mode.

image:./RISC-V-Trace-Control-Interface-images/swt-uart.jpg[image]

=== PIB Parallel Protocol

Traditionally, off-chip trace has used this protocol. There are a number of parallel data signals and one continuously-running clock reference. The data rate of several parallel signals can be much higher than either of the serial-wire protocols.

As with SWT modes, this protocol is oriented to full trace messages rather than fixed-width trace words. The idle state of TRC_DATA is all-ones for Nexus trace and (TBD) for Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace) Specification. When a message start is detected, this sample and possibly the next few (depending on the width of TRC_DATA) are collected until a complete byte has been received. Bytes are transmitted LSB first, with TRC_DATA[0] representing the LSB in each beat of data. The receiver continues collecting bytes until a complete message has been received. The criteria for this depends on the trace format. For Nexus, the last byte of a message is one that has mseo=1,1. For E-Trace, the header byte may include a byte count. After the last byte of a message, the data signals may then go their idle state or a new message may begin in the next bit period.

NOTE: Trace messages may start on any (positive or negative) edge of trace clock. Once message is started all bits of that message must be transmitted on concecutive trace clock edges (both positive and negative). Said so, idle sequence may be sent consist of any number of trace clocks edges (positive or negative). But some implementations may always send idle sequences using even number of trace clocks - in such a case all packets will always start on positive or negative trace clock.

The trace clock, TRC_CLK, normally has edges coincident with the TRC_DATA edges. Typically, a trace probe will delay trace data or use a PLL to recover a sampling clock that is twice the frequency of TRC_CLK and shifted 90 degrees so that its rising edges occur near the center of each bit period. If the PIB implementation supports it, the debugger can set trPibClkCenter to change the timing of TRC_CLK so that there is a TRC_CLK edge at the center of each bit period on TRC_DATA. Note that this option cuts the data rate in half relative to normal parallel mode and still requires the probe to sample TRC_DATA on both edges of TRC_CLK.

This example shows 8-bit parallel mode with trPibClkCenter=0 transmitting a 5-byte message followed by a 2-byte message.

== Trace ATB Bridge

Some SoCs may have an Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) infrastructure to manage trace produced by other components. In such systems, it is feasible to route RISC-V trace output to the ATB through an ATB Bridge. This module manages the interface to ATB, generating ATB trace records that encapsulate RISC-V trace produced by the Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel. There is a control register that includes trace on/off control and a field allowing software to set the Trace Source ID to be used on the ATB. This Trace Source ID allows software to extract RISC-V trace from the combined trace. This interface is compatible with AMBA 4 ATB v1.1.

An implementation determines the data widths of the connection from the Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel and of the ATB port.

== Reset and Discovery

This chapter describes what trace tool should do to reset and discover trace features. 

IMPORTANT: Trace tool must be provided with base addresses of all trace components.

There are several (independent) reset bits defined by this specification

* trTeActive - reset for Trace Encoder component (this will disable encoder from single hart)
* trFunnelActive - reset for Trace Funnel component
* trPibActive - reset for PIB component (resets Probe Interface Block only)
* trRamActive - reset for RAM component (resets RAM Sink only)
* trAtbBridgeActive - resets ATB Bridge component (resets ATB Bridge interface)

These reset bits should (when kept low) reset most of other registers/fields/bits to defined reset values.

Releasing component from reset may take time - debug tool should monitor (with reasonable timeout) if appropriate bit should changed from 0 to 1. Other fields/bits should remain unchanged (as were set during reset).

NOTE: Some of reset values are defined as 'SD' (system dependent) and these values should reset as well and each time to same value as would be after power-up.

NOTE: Some bigger registers (holding RAM addresseses) may not reset - debugger is expected to write to them before enabling trace. These registers have 'Undef' in reset field. It should not prevent some implementations to reset these.

Reset and Discovery should be performned as follows:

* Reset particular component by setting 'tr??Active = 0'.
* Read-back and wait until 'tr??Active = 0' is read.
* Save 'tr??Control' register as it holds all reset values (it may prevent tool to do read-modify operation later).
* Release from reset by setting 'tr??Active=1' and wait for 'tr??Active=1' to be read (to confirm component is not in reset). 

IMPORTANT: When 'tr??Active=1' is set no other bits should be changed. 

* Handle 'tr??VerMinor/Major' as described in 'Versioning of Components' chapter.
** If tr??VerMajor' is 0 (for Trace Encoder component ...) either handle it as legacy version 0 or abort with an error.
* Read 'tr??Impl' and compare 'tr??ComType' field with expected value.
* Set some WARL fields and read back to discover supported component configuration - make sure component is NOT enabled (by setting 'tr??Enabled=1' by mistake).
* Configure some initial values in all needed registers/fields. Read-back each one to assure these are set properly.

As we are dealing with several independent components, it is important to assure, that component which is in reset (or powered down) is keeping it's outputs on safe values, so garbage trace data is not emitted.

In general it is safer to power-up and enable components starting from sinks/bridge, followed by Funnel and Encoder as last. Each implementation should test this sequence.

== Enabling and Disabling

Enabling should work as follows:

* Release all needed components from reset by setting 'tr??Active=1' as described above.
* Set desired mode and verify if that mode is set (regardless of discovery results).
* For RAM Sink:
** Setup needed addresses (if possible and desired) as these may not reset.
* For PIB Sink:
** Calibrate PIB (if possible and desired).
** Start physical trace capture (probe dependent).
* Configure RAM Sink/PIB Sink/ATB Bridge in appropriate mode.
** Verify if particular mode is set.
* Set main enable for RAM Sink/PIB Sink/ATB Bridge component by setting 'tr??Enable=1'.
** Read back and wait for confirmation (tr??Enable=1).
* Enable Trace Funnel[s] in the same way.
* Configure and Enable Trace Encoder[s] in the same way.
* Either  manually set 'trTeInstTracing=1' and/or 'trTeDataTracing=1' bits or setup triggesr to start the trace .
* Start hart[s] to be traced (hart could be already running as well - in this case trace will be generated in the moment when 'trTe????Tracing' bit was set)
* Periodically read 'trTeControl' for status of trace (as it may stop by itself due to triggers).
** If RAM Sink was configured with 'trRamStopOnWrap=1', read 'trRamEnable' to see if RAM capture was stopped. 

NOTE: Discovery may not be necessary to enable and test trace during development of SoC. However discovery must be possible and should be tested by SoC designer - this is necessary for trace tools to work with that SoC without any customization.

NOTE: Trace tool may verify particular setting once per session, so subsequent starts of trace may be faster.

NOTE: Trace tools should provide configuration setting allowing more verbose logging mode during discovery and initialization, so potential compatibility issues may be solved.

Disabling the trace should work as follows:

* It is essential to disable the trace from encoders associated with stopped harts as entering debug more is NOT flushing any trace pipelines.
* Disable and flush trace starting from Encoders, then Funnels and finally Sinks or Bridges.
** Set 'tr??Enable=0' and wait for 'tr??Enable=0' and 'tr??Empty=1' for each trace component.
** It is important to do it in that order as otherwise data may be lost.
* Stop physical capture if PIB sink was enabled (probe dependent).
* Read the trace.
** For RAM Trace Sink read 'trRamWP' - depending on trRamWrap bit, you may read trace from two ranges.
** For RAM Trace Sink in SRAM mode, set 'trRamRP' and read 'trRamData' multiple times.
** For RAM Trace Sink in SBA mode, read trace from SBA using memory read.
** For PIB Trace Sink read trace from trace probe.
** For ATB Bridge, read trace using Coresight compoments (ETB/TMC/TPIU).

Decoding trace

* Decoder (in most cases) must have an access to code which is running on device either by reading it from device or from a file containg the code (binary/hex/srec/ELF).
* Trace collected by trace probes can be read and decoded while trace is being captured (this is called trace streaming mode).
** There is no guarantee that last trace packet is completed until trace is properly flushed and disabled.
* Decoding of trace should never affect code being traced.

== Legacy Interface Version

Value of 'teVersion/tfVersion' as 0 means this is original version of this interface.

As there are some implementations with trTeVersion = 0 it is important to provide changes, so tools may work with it.

 Trace components are now separated into 4K blocks

* Some registers/fields got renamed for clarity and uniformity

* Field trTeInstTrigEnable was not present, so global enable/disable for instruction trace triggers was not possible

* Field trTeInstStallDelta was not present, so debugger may not know if hart was ever stalled

* Fields teSyncMode and teSyncMax were defined as 'teSyncMaxBTM and teSyncMaxInst' 

* Fields pibEmpty and atbEmpty were not defined (trace control should wait to assure that trace was flushed correctly) 

* Register trTeInstFeatures was not present (was reading as 0)

* Register trTeDataControl register was not present (as version 0 did not support data trace)

* 16-bit parallel mode for PIB was not defined (these implementations were using max 8-bit of parallel trace)
