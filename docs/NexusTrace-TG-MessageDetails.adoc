This comment is taken AS-IS from iommu_intro.adoc file
Please in ditaa figures don't use the minus key '-' in your keyboard when
typing text (like 'non-privileged' in the figure below).
'-' is a special character that is used by ditaa to draw lines, not text.
Instead use a different unicode character that looks similar.
The figure below uses the unicode character with code U+2212 instead of the '-'
character of your keyboard (which has the unicode code U+002B).
Note that in your editor both probably look the same, but when rendered by
ditaa/asciidoc the '-' from your keyboard is used to draw a line, while the
alternative looks as a minus symbol.
If you don't know how to type an unicode character in your editor you might
simply copy the '−' character in the 'non−privileged' word from the drawing
below.

== Definitions and Terminology

[#Terms Used In This Specification]
.Terms Used In This Specification
[cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Term| Definition
|Message|N-Trace messages are sequences of bytes. First byte of every message includes TCODE fields, which defines the type of information carried in the message and its format. When messages are transmitted or stored a protocol, described in <<chapter_Transmission_Protocol,N-Trace Transmission Protocol>> chapter, defines the start and the end of each message.
|Field| A field is a distinct piece of the information contained within a message, and messages may contain one or more fields (in addition to the first TCODE field). Fields can be either of fixed or variable size. Several fields may be packet into single byte and single field may span across multiple bytes. Definitions of all fields can be found in <<Fields in Messages>> chapter.
|Variable Field|Specifying that a field is variable-size (*Var* used as field size definition) means that the message must contain the field, but that the field's size may vary from a minimum of 1 bit. When messages are transferred or stored, variable-size fields must end on a byte boundary. If necessary, they must zero-fill bit positions beyond the highest order bit of the variable data. Because variable-size fields may be of different lengths in messages of the same type, When messages are transmitted or stored a protocol, described in <<chapter_Transmission_Protocol,N-Trace Transmission Protocol>> chapter, defines the end of each variable field.
|Configurable Field|Configurable field (*Cfg* used as field size) means that existence and size of this field depends on some configuration setting. See chapter <<N-Trace Specific Trace Controls>> for more details.
|<<TODO>>| Add more?
|======================================================================================================

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Original Nexus specification is showing tables with *TCODE* (which is sent first) in the last row. This specification shows fields in messages in order of sending them (first field sent is described first).
* This will be consistent with storage order, processing and text dump order.
====

== Ingress Port

N-Trace encoder is using same ingress port as defined in <<E-Trace Specification>> (chapter `4 Instruction Trace Interface``).

As this version of N-Trace encoder specification does not define data trace, <<E-Trace Specification>> chapter `4.3 Data Trace Interface requirements` and chapter `4.4 Data Trace Interface` are not applicable.

E-Trace Specification describes when each 'itype' (instruction type) is generated, but table below provides detailed map of encoding into 'itype'.

IMPORTANT: N-Trace encoder does does not require *cause* and *tvar* ingress port signals (valid for exceptions and interrupts only) as these are not reported in N-Trace messages. N-Trace is only proving address of exception/interrupt handler.

[[chapter_Transmission_Protocol]]
== N-Trace Transmission Protocol 

The Nexus standard defines a trace messaging protocol using a number of *MDO* (Message Data Out) signals and one or two flag signals known as *MSEO* (Message Start/End Out). A Nexus message is sent or stored in slices composed of *MDO* and *MSEO*. 

N-Trace messages transmission protocol is a strict subset of Nexus trace messaging protocol.

[cols="33%,22%,45%",options="header",]
|====
|Protocol Feature|Defined in Nexus IEEE 5001|N-Trace (strict subset of Nexus)
|Number of *MSEO* bits|1 or 2|2
|Number of *MDO* bits|At least 1|6
|Total slice (*MDO*+*MSEO*) bits|At least 2|8 (one byte)
|Order (transmitted or stored)|Vendor defined|*MSEO* before *MDO*, each LSB first
|Max field size|Not specified|64 bits (some 32 bits or less)
|Max message size|Not specified|38 bytes (worst sum of all fields)
|====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* N-Trace specification defines 6-bit *MDO* and 2-bit *MSEO* so each slice fits in a single byte.
** It allows easy storage in memory as well as sending using 1-bit/ 2-bit/ 4-bit/ 8-bit/ 16-bit parallel transport (which is supported by many existing trace probes and connectors).
** Decoding software may work on bytes and 32-bit/64-bit words and expect MSEO bits at two LSB bits of each byte.
* Max message size (38 bytes) is calculated for IndirectBranchHistSync message which includes TCODE/ SRC/ SYNC/ B-TYPE(5 bytes total), I-CNT(30 bits, 5 bytes), F-ADDR(63 bits, 11 bytes), HIST(32 bits, 6 bytes) TSTAMP(64 bits, 11 bytes).
** Particular hardware may provide smaller limit (usually I-CNT is smaller), but always must assure that internal FIFOs must be designed to hold at least two longest messages.
** Decoding software may avoid allocating dynamic memory, but every conforming decoder must survive any size of message as trace memory may be corrupted (trace with all 0-s is considered as very long variable size field).
====

=== MSEO Sequences

The first slice of a message sends the LSBs of the message and is indicated by *MSEO=00*.

A variable-length field in a message always ends on a slice boundary (zero extended as needed) and the last slice of a variable field is indicated by *MSEO=01*. Initial slices of longer variable-length fields are sent using *MSEO=00*.

The last slice of a message is indicated by *MSEO=11*. It also implies an end of the last field of message.

Value of *MSEO=10* is reserved for future extensions.

[#MSEO Transitions]
.Allowed MSEO Transitions
[cols="30%,30%",options="header",]
|====
|MSEO Function|Dual MSEO[1:0] Sequence
|Start of message|11s-00
|End of message|00 (or 01)-11-(more 11s)
|End of variable-length field|00 (or 01)-01
|Message transmission|00s
|Idle (no message)|11s
|Reserved|any-10
|====

[NOTE]
====
Original Nexus specification defines the MSEO protocol as follows:

* Two `1`-s followed by one `0` indicates the start of a message.
* `0` followed by two or more `1`-s indicates the end of a message.
* `0` followed by `1` followed by `0` indicates the end of a variable-length field.
* `0`-s at all other clocks during transmission of a message.
* `1`-s at all clocks during no message transmission (idle).

Dual MSEO protocol (defined in this N-Trace specification) is a subset of general (single and dual) MSEO protocol definition.
====

=== Unified N-Trace Message Structure

Each N-Trace message has identical structure (100% compatible with Nexus):

* Very first field is ALWAYS fixed size *TCODE* (Transport Code) which defines meaning and format of subsequent fields.
* In case of simultaneous tracing from more than one hart, second field is ALWAYS fixed size *SRC* (Message Source) field, which provides unique ID of message source.
** This field allows trace decoders to separate messages from different trace sources (Trace Encoders, harts) without knowing any details of each of messages.
** This method can be used to handle different (opaque) trace or debug or performance data using N-Trace transport/storage/export infrastructure. 
* Very last field is (optional) variable size *TSTAMP* (Timestamp) field.   
** It may be possible to generate and analyze timestamps in unified (simpler) way.

=== Example

Table below shows one N-Trace message with several fields. It is an output from N-Trace dump tool (part of N-Trace reference C code) with an added *Explanation* column.

|0xD0| 110100|00 | BTYPE[2] = 0x0| This is a 2-bit (fixed size) field. As B-TYPE is a fixed size field, four MSB bits are part of the next field (I-CNT).

|0x1D| 000111|01 | UADDR[6] = 0x7| This is a single byte variable size U-ADDR field (with three MSB 0-s bits).
|0xF8| 111110|00 || Normal transfer of new field (6 LSB bits).
|0xFF| 111111|11 | HIST[12] = 0xFFE| Last byte of message. It implies the end of 12-bit HIST field. In this field we do not have any extra 0-bits on MSB.
5+|Here we could have TSTAMP field (previous MSEO should became 01, what means end of field, but not end of message)

|======================================================================================================

NOTE: Above table does not provide names of trace control registers as names of bits/fields used in Trace Control Interface are unique.

[#Nexus Trace Modes]
== Nexus Trace Modes

Nexus standard defined two main modes of 

[[mode_BTM]]
* BTM (Branch Trace Messaging) - every taken branch is generating at least two byte message, but repeated branch may be counted and reported as count. 
[[mode_HTM]]
* HTM (Branch History Messaging) - every branch (taken or not-taken) adds a bit to history buffer. It is TODO 

Encoder must implement at least one of these modes, however it is unlikely both HTM and BTM modes will be available.

== Nexus Messages (Details)

IMPORTANT: Names `Indirect Branch ...` used by Nexus standard may be confusing as RISC-V ISA only allows direct (always relative) branches. Also RISC-V ISA is differentiating jumps (un-conditional flow changes) and branches (conditional flow changes), while in Nexus terminology any flow change (including exceptions/interrupts) are always named as branches.

=== Fields in Messages

Table below shows all types of messages. Single row shows all fields in particular message. Many messages share fields and these fields are always present in same order.

[NOTE]
====
. Size of fields: *[n]* means *n*-bit (fixed-size) field, *[Var]* means variable size, always present field, *[Cfg]* means size which depends on encoder configuration option.
. Any message may include optional <<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>> *[Var]* field as very last field of a message.
** Field <<field_PAD,PAD>> *[Cfg]* provides (optional) 0-bit padding to assure that <<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>> field is starting at byte-boundary (size is specified as *[Cfg]* as it's size depends on size of <<field_TSTAMP,SRC>> field).

4+|*Fields used in many messages*
[[field_TCODE]]
| TCODE      | 6             | Transfer Code | Message header that identifies the number and/or size of fields to be transferred, and how to interpret each of the fields following it.
[[field_SRC]]
| SRC        | *Cfg*, max=12 | Source of Message Transmission | This optional field is used to identify the source of the message transmission. In configurations that comprise only a single hart, this field need not be transmitted. For processors that comprise multiple harts, this field must be transmitted as part of the message to identify the source of the message transmission. Within a given device, the SRC should be the same size across all trace encoders (associated).

[[field_FADDR]]
| F-ADDR      | *Var*, max=63 | Full Target Address | Full PC address (LSB bit, which is always 0 for RISC-V is skipped).
F-ADDR field is always sent together with <<field_SYNC,SYNC>> field.
[[field_UADDR]]

|======================================================================================================

Original Nexus specification does not define limits for variable size fields, but N-Trace provides some limits. It will help to write efficient decoding software but is not limiting hardware in any way.

[[NTRACE_MAX_ICNT]]
|I-CNT|NTRACE_MAX_ICNT|22|Usually smaller value will be sufficient.
[[NTRACE_MAX_ADDR]]
|x-ADDR|NTRACE_MAX_ADDR|63|LSB bit is always 0 for RISC-V addresses so 63 bits only.
[[NTRACE_MAX_HIST]]
|HIST|NTRACE_MAX_HIST|32|It includes stop-bit. This size is optimal for not wasting any bits for often used Resource Full message.
[[NTRACE_MAX_TSTAMP]]
|TSTAMP|NTRACE_MAX_TSTAMP|64|It is certainly bit enough. Corresponds to architecture defined timer and clock cycle registers.

== Message Details

This chapter provides detailed description of all N-Trace messages.
Each message has own table showing all fields in that message.
Fields are ALWAYS listed on order from first to last (and LSB to MSB if placed in the same byte). 
Common fields are described in <<Common Fields>> chapter, but fields specific to particular message TCODE are explained here.

Overview of all fields in all messages is provided in <<Fields in Messages>> table above.

Size of field in *Bits* column may be one or more of the following values:

* *n (1..6)* - This is *n*-bits wide, fixed size field.
* *Var* - This is variable size field.
* *Cfg* - Size of this field depends on configuration setting (*Cfg* fields is always optional).
* *Opt* - This field is optional (depends on value of one of preceding fields).

[[msg2_Ownership]]
=== Ownership Message

This message provides necessary context (privileged mode and OS-assigned Context ID) allowing decoder to associate program flow with different parts of code which belong to different programs. It is reported in one of these three conditions:

* When instruction which is changing privilege mode is executed.
* Immediately following any trace synchronization message (which include SYNC field).
* At entry and returns to/from exceptions and interrupts (as these are usually changing privilege modes).

[#Fields_Ownership]
.Ownership Message Fields
[cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Bits|Name|Description
|6   |TCODE            |Value=2. Standard Transfer Code (<<field_TCODE,TCODE>>) field.
|Cfg |SRC              |Standard Message Source (<<field_SRC,SRC>>) field.
[[field_PROCESS]]
|Var |PROCESS          |This is variable size field, which encodes *V* and *PRV* privilege mode bits as well as *scontext/hcontext* values. Details are provided below.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes* 

Field PROCESS is encoded as 4 sub-fields (FORMAT, PRV, V, CONTEXT):

.Encoding of PROCESS field (LSB to MSB order)
[cols="40%,15%,10%,10%,25%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Reason|FORMAT:2|PRV:2|V:1|Context:var
| V or PRV change |00   |Yes|Yes|--
| Reserved  |01|--|--|--
| Sync or scontext change |10|Yes|Yes|*scontext* value
| Sync or hcontext change |11|Yes|Yes|*hcontext* value
|======================================================================================================

Encodings of *V/PRV* follow ISA privilege mode encodings and are encoded as follows:

 U-mode:     V=0, PRV=00
 S-mode:     V=0, PRV=01
 M-mode:     V=0, PRV=11
 VU-mode:    V=1, PRV=00
 VS-mode:    V=1, PRV=01

All unused encodings are reserved.

Examples:

 PROCESS=0x3B2 = 0b11101_1_00_10   => hcontext=0x1D,V=1,PRV=00  (VU-mode) 
 PROCESS=0xC           0b0_11_00   => V=0,PRV=11                (M-mode) 

[[msg2_DirectBranch]]
=== DirectBranch Message

This message is generated when taken branch retired. It is applicable to <<mode_BTM,BTM>> mode only.

[#Fields_DirectBranch]
.Direct Branch Message Fields
[cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Bits|Name|Description
|6   |TCODE            |Value=3. Standard Transfer Code (<<field_TCODE,TCODE>>) field.
|Cfg |SRC              |Standard Message Source (<<field_SRC,SRC>>) field.
|Var |I-CNT            |Standard Instruction Count (<<field_ICNT,I-CNT>>) field.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes* 

Last instruction in the code block (or blocks) with all inferable instructions (described by I-CNT) is a direct taken branch instruction. Next PC is determined by taking [+-]offset (from opcode of that branch instruction) and adding it to an address of branch instruction.

NOTE: Non-taken branches or direct jumps are NOT generating any trace but increase I-CNT (and jumps are changing PC to jump destination address), so PC of last instruction in code block[s] can be found.

[[msg2_IndirectBranch]]
=== IndirectBranch Message

This message is generated when an instruction causing indirect control flow change retired. It is applicable to <<mode_BTM,BTM>> mode only.

[#Fields_IndirectBranch]
.Indirect Branch Message Fields
[cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Bits|Name|Description

|2   |BTYPE            |Standard Instruction Count (<<field_BTYPE,BTYPE>>) field.
|Var |I-CNT            |Standard Instruction Count (<<field_ICNT,I-CNT>>) field.
|Var |U-ADDR           |Standard Unique Address (<<field_UADDR,U-ADDR>>) field.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes* 

Last instruction in the code block (or blocks) (described by I-CNT) is an indirect control flow change (jump, call, return) instruction. Next PC is determined by the XOR of the U-ADDR field with the recent address being transmitted (either as F-ADDR or as U-ADDR). See <<TODO>> for more details.

NOTE: Non-taken branches or direct jumps are NOT generating any trace but increase I-CNT (and jumps are changing PC to jump destination address), so PC of last instruction in code block[s] can be found.

[[msg2_Error]]
=== Error Message

[#Fields_Error]

[cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Bits|Name|Description

|Cfg |SRC              |Standard Message Source (<<field_SRC,SRC>>) field.
[[field_ETYPE]]
|4   |ETYPE            |Error type. Subset of standard Nexus encoding:

0: Queue Overrun caused messages (one or more) to be lost.

1..7: Reserved.

0x8..0xF: Reserved for Vendor Defined Error(s).

|2,Cfg |PAD            |Pad ETYPE field with 0-s to end of byte, so TSTAMP field always begins on byte boundary.
When the SRC field is not present PAD is a 2-bit field. Otherwise size is determined by (configurable) size of SRC field (and can be 0 if SRC is 2-bit field for example). This is the only place where padding like this is needed.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes*

Error Message must be sent immediately prior to a synchronization message as soon as space is available in the Trace Encoder output queue. It should be time-stamped at the moment when the trace messages got dropped.

[NOTE]
====
This message is required as otherwise decoder (despite the fact that restart after FIFO overflow is signaled) would not be aware that trace was lost in case of the following sequence of events:

* Trace is turned off by trigger (or from any other reason).
* Message signalling 'trace off' event is lost (due to lack of space for it).
* Trace is never restarted.
* Trace is stopped (this will not generate any trace as trace is turned off)

|Cfg |SRC              |Standard Message Source (<<field_SRC,SRC>>) field.
|4   |SYNC             |Standard Synchronization Reason (<<field_SYNC,SYNC>>) field.
|Var |I-CNT            |Standard Instruction Count (<<field_ICNT,I-CNT>>) field.
|Var |F-ADDR           |Standard Full Address (<<field_FADDR,F-ADDR>>) field.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes*

This message is generated at start/restart of trace. I-CNT field must be 0 in such a case. However for some values of SYNC (like `External Trace Trigger`), I-CNT field may not be 0 and may be used to identify exact PC location when that particular trigger/event happened. Field F-ADDR provides full address.

.Direct Branch with Sync Message Fields
[cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]

|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes*

This message is generated in same conditions as <<msg2_DirectBranch,DirectBranch>> message, but additionally provides reason for synchronization (SYNC field) and full PC (F-ADDR field).

[[msg2_IndirectBranchSync]]
=== IndirectBranchSync Message

[#Fields_IndirectBranchSync]
.Indirect Branch with Sync Message Fields
[cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|======================================================================================================
|Bits|Name|Description
|6   |TCODE            |Value=12(0xC). Standard Transfer Code (<<field_TCODE,TCODE>>) field.
|Cfg |SRC              |Standard Message Source (<<field_SRC,SRC>>) field.
|4   |SYNC             |Standard Synchronization Reason (<<field_SYNC,SYNC>>) field.
|Var |I-CNT            |Standard Instruction Count (<<field_ICNT,I-CNT>>) field.
|Var |F-ADDR           |Standard Full Address (<<field_FADDR,F-ADDR>>) field.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes*

Last instruction in code block (described by I-CNT) is an indirect control flow change (jump, call, return) instruction. Next PC is provided as F-ADDR field in this message.

NOTE: Non-taken branches or direct jumps are NOT generating any trace but increase I-CNT (and jumps are changing PC to jump destination address)

[[msg2_ResourceFull]]
=== Resource Full Message

This message is emitted when HIST mask or I-CNT counter has reached max value for particular implementation.

|Cfg |SRC              |Standard Message Source (<<field_SRC,SRC>>) field.
[[field_RCODE]]
|4   |RCODE            |Standard Resource Code field (defines a meaning of RDATA fields).

0: Standard: HIST field has overflown and is reported in RDATA[0] field.

1: Standard: I-CNT counter has overflown and is reported in RDATA[0] field.

*2*: *Extension:* HIST field has overflown and is repeated. RDATA[0] field holds HIST value and RDATA[1] field holds HREPEAT (history repeat) value.

3-7: Standard: Reserved for future encodings.

8-0xF: Standard: Reserved for vendor specific encodings.
[[field_RDATA]]
|Var|RDATA [0]         |Standard: For RCODE=0 this is HIST field (with MSB=1 being stop-bit). For RCODE=1, this is I-CNT field.

*Extension:* For RCODE=2 this is HIST field (with MSB=1 being stop-bit). For RCODE=1, this is I-CNT field.
|Var,Opt|RDATA [1]     |*Extension:* When RCODE=2 is reported this fields includes HREPEAT (history repeat) count.
|Var,Cfg |TSTAMP       |Standard Timestamp (<<field_TSTAMP,TSTAMP>>) field.
|======================================================================================================

*Explanations and Notes* 

* Reported I-CNT value (with RCODE=1) may be a bit larger than <<NTRACE_MAX_ICNT,NTRACE_MAX_ICNT>> (it is because ingress port may provide several instructions retired in the same cycle). It means encoder may have I-CNT counter to be one bit bigger than <<NTRACE_MAX_ICNT,NTRACE_MAX_ICNT>> and when MSB bit is set, message with RCODE=1 should be generated.
* Not repeated HIST field overflow (RCODE=0) will usually include longest supported by particular hardware HIST field.
** However any number of HIST bits may be transmitted (from 2 to <<NTRACE_MAX_HIST,NTRACE_MAX_HIST>> bits).
* When both I-CNT and HIST are overflowing in the same time, encoder may send HIST overflow and I-CNT overflow in any order and decoder must handle this correctly.
* More details are provided in <<HIST Pattern Detection>> chapter.

*Explanations and Notes* 

Last instruction in the code block (or blocks) (described by HIST and I-CNT fields) is an indirect control flow change (jump, call, return) instruction or this packet is generated when exception or interrupt is reported in ingress port. See <<HIST Field Generation>> and <<I-CNT Details>> chapter for clarifications.

Next PC (after indirect jump or exception/interrupt handler) is determined by the XOR of the U-ADDR field with the recent address being transmitted (either as F-ADDR or as U-ADDR). See <<Address Compression>> chapter for more details.

*Explanations and Notes* 

It provides a reason (in EVCODE field) plus I-CNT and HIST fields, which allows decoder to determine PC where trace actually stopped.

== Field Encoding and Calculation Techniques

This chapter describes in details how key fields (I-CNT, HIST, U-ADDR/F-ADDR and TSTAMP) are calculated and encoded.

[#field_xADDR]
=== Address Compression

Address transmissions are fully compliant with the Nexus specification.

* Address fields are being sent beginning with bit 1 since all execution addresses are on 2-byte boundaries.
* Addresses sent in <<field_UADDR,U-ADDR>> compressed form are computed based on a reference address sent by or computed from the most recent preceding message containing an address field. 
* Starting with an <<field_FADDR,F-ADDR>>, each U-ADDR modifies the reference address used for the next address. 
* A U-ADDR is generated by XORing the full address with the reference address and sending the result starting with bit 1 and with high-order zeroes suppressed.
* The reverse process is used by software to recover the original full address. 

Example:

=== HIST Field Generation

When encoder is operating in <<mode_HTM,HTM>> mode direct branches do NOT generate any messages. Instead each taken or not-taken branch is adding single bit as LSB bit of HIST field (simple left-shift register). If branch is taken bit=1 is added on LSB position. If branch is not taken, bit=0 is added on LSB position.

MSB value 1 in HIST field is used as stop-bit. It allows HIST field to be transmitted as variable size field efficiently (as MSB=0 are not transmitted).

Examples:

 Binary: 101,    hex: 0x5  (two branches, first not taken, second taken)
 Binary: 1111,   hex: 0xF  (three branches, all three taken)
 Binary: 10000,  hex: 0x10 (four branches, all four not taken)
 Binary: 1,      hex: 0x1  (no branches at all)

HIST field is reset (to 1, which is just a stop-bit) each time it is transmitted (it includes every Sync message).

IMPORTANT: Decoder must interpret HIST fields starting from MSB bit (the one before stop-bit = 1). This is the bit which is encoding first encountered branch.

==== HIST Field Overflows

HIST field is usually implemented as shift register (initialized to 1 at reset). This register is shifted left and 0 or 1 is added to it. When MSB bit of this register becomes 1, it means that stop-bit reached end of register and HIST field must be sent.

If this is happening <<msg2_ResourceFull,ResourceFull>> with HIST field must be generated.

NOTE: Trace decoder do not have to be aware about actual size of HIST field implemented by encoder, however in order to allow efficient implementation of trace encoders (and also allowing HIST pattern detection) N-Trace implementation limits HIST size to max 32-bits. Longer HIST do not provide much of gain and is making HIST pattern detection more costly (in terms of hardware resources).

When HIST buffer is identical in two or more consecutive <<msg2_ResourceFull,ResourceFull>> messages, it can be detected and reported using HIST + HREPEAT (History Repeat Counter) instead many identical messages.

See <<Repeated History Optimization>> chapter for more details.

=== I-CNT Details

Field I-CNT (present in most messages) includes count of 16-bit instruction units reported as retired.

Here are key rules how encoder must handle I-CNT field:

* Every retired instruction MUST increment I-CNT by 1 (for 16-bit instruction) or by 2 (for 32-bit instruction). Specifically:
** If instruction is changing the PC, that instruction itself MUST update I-CNT.
** An exception or interrupt before retirement of an instruction CANNOT update I-CNT.
** An exception or interrupt after retirement of an instruction MUST update I-CNT. 
* If I-CNT is reported in a message it MUST be reset to 0.
** I-CNT may be additionally reset after each conditional branch (in HTM mode) but it must be directly enabled (see below for more details).

==== I-CNT Handling in BTM mode

As an illustration, let's consider the following piece of pseudo-code (... does not matter):

    0x100:  ADD ...         ; Plain linear 16-bit instruction
    0x102:  B... 0x200      ; Conditional branch (32-bit instruction)
    0x106:  ADD ...         ; Plain linear 32-bit instruction
    0x10A:  B... 0x300      ; Conditional branch (32-bit instruction)
    0x10E:  ADD ...         ; Plain linear 16-bit instruction
    0x110:  ADD ...         ; Plain linear 32-bit instruction
    0x114   ...

Let's assume we start a trace from address 0x100 (ProgramTraceSync with I-CNT=0 and F-ADDR encoding address = 0x100 should be generated) and let's assume that we collect a trace for this program (in <<mode_BTM,BTM>> mode) 3 times. 

* First time a branch at address 0x102 is taken.
** A Direct Branch message with I-CNT=3 should be generated. It means, that a code block from <0x100..0x106> (as 6=2*3) was executed and a branch at the end of this block was taken. Decoder will know PC=0x200 from an opcode of branch at an address 0x102.
* Second time a branch at address 0x102 is not taken and a branch at address 0x10A is taken.
** A Direct Branch message with I-CNT=7 should be generated. It means, that a code block from <0x100..0x10E> (as 0xE=2*7) was executed and a branch at the end of this block was taken. Decoder will know PC=0x300 from an opcode of branch at an address 0x10A.
* Third time both branches are not taken.
** In this case we will see I-CNT > 7. It means that none of the branches were taken and the decoder should continue analysis of code from an address 0x10E.

NOTE: Decoder must look at each instruction in code block to know it's size. It cannot calculate <current PC+I-CNT*2> as it is UNKNOWN what is the size of last instruction being retired - it may be (compressed) 16-bit or 32-bit (not-compressed) branch.

Above we analyzed some I-CNT values. Let's consider other I-CNT values.

* I-CNT=1 is a correct value. The only valid reason to generate a message with I-CNT=1 would be an exception (or interrupt) BEFORE an instruction at address 0x102. In this case an encoder should generate *IndirectBranch* or *IndirectBranchSync* message with I-CNT=1, BTYPE=1 (exception) and U-ADDR/F-ADDR field encoding an address of an exception/interrupt handler.

* I-CNT=5 is also correct (which means, that exception happened BEFORE an instruction at address 0x10A).

* I-CNT=0 is also possible. It should be generated when interrupt was pending before we started the core (and trace) and instruction at address 0x100 was not executed/retired. Another reason for ICNT=0 may be a case, where instruction at address 0x100 will generate page fault (pre-fetch abort) or is illegal. 

* I-CNT=4 (and I-CNT=6) are *INCORRECT values* as it would mean that only half of corresponding 32-bit instruction was executed.

IMPORTANT: Decoder must report such an incorrect I-CNT values and immediately abort decoding as it means that either an encoder is not conforming to this specification or trace was captured incorrectly. Decoding may resume at next SYNC message, but it is not mandatory for all decoders to do so.

==== I-CNT Handling in HTM mode

When the encoder is operating in HTM mode, these branches (from code piece above ...) by itself will NOT generate any trace packets, but each of them will add a bit to HIST field. But still I-CNT should be incremented at every retired instruction.

Above code may generate messages with the following fields (exact types of messages depend on code not visible in that example):

* I-CNT >= 3, HIST=0b1_1... (MSB=1 is stop bit, bit pattern '1...' means that first branch was taken). Encoder should continue from address 0x200 (as first branch encountered was taken).
* I-CNT >= 7, HIST=0b1_01... (MSB=1 is stop bit, bit pattern '01...' means that first branch was not taken and second branch was taken). Encoder should continue from address 0x300 (as second branch encountered was taken).
* I-CNT >= 7, HIST-0b1_00... (MSB=1 is stop bit, bit pattern '00...' means that two branches were not taken). Encoder should continue from address 0x10E.

NOTE: It is obviously visible, that HTM mode provides much better trace compression as trace messages are not generated at every taken branch.

==== Additional I-CNT resets

When encoder is operating in HTM mode and encoder will emit a HIST bit, it is really not necessary to know how many instructions were executed before or between (taken or not) branch instruction.

If we look at above code example, when encoder knows HIST=0b100... pattern, it will analyze the code from instruction at address 0x100. It will continue forward until branch instruction is found. If branch instruction is found, it will either continue to next PC (if branch was reported as not-taken) or calculate PC (from current PC and opcode) and continue from branch destination address.

Number of instructions (value of I-CNT) only matters after last branch (or before reaching very first branch). If we reset I-CNT every time HIST bit (taken or not-taken is added), then reported I-CNT counters will be smaller. It is especially important when encoder is operating in <<Inferable Return>> mode as in such a case a lot of instructions may be encoded in single message. Sending big I-CNT value will not provide any new information.

==== I-CNT Field Overflows

When I-CNT overflows, the <<msg_ResourceFull,Resource Full>> message with RCODE=1 should be generated.

[# Timestamp Details]
=== Timestamp Details

If timestamp recording is enabled, Sync messages all include an absolute timestamp value with upper zeroes suppressed. Other message types with timestamps emit timestamp relative to recently reported (absolute or relative timestamp).

NOTE: The TSTAMP field is variable size field and MSB bits=0 will not be transmitted. It will provide good compression for relative and absolute timestamp.

To reconstruct the full timestamp, software begins at a Sync message and stores the TSTAMP value found there, zero-extended to the full timestamp width. Shortly after starting a trace session, even a 64-bit timestamp will typically require far less than 64 bits to transmit. Software extracts the compressed TSTAMP from each message thereafter and XORs it with the previous decompressed timestamp to obtain the full timestamp value associated with this message. Example:

The following rules must be observed:

* If timestamps are enabled, ALL Sync messages (which include full address) must include absolute TSTAMP value.
** Otherwise some sections of decoded trace would have timestamp and some not and it would be hard for end user to comprehend such a trace.
* It is permitted that some non-Sync messages are not reporting timestamp 
* Absolute timestamp cannot exceed 64 bits (even with 1ps resolution, 64-bit counter will overflow in about 584 years).
** Implementation may choose smaller counter - trace tools may assume timestamp will not overflow in single session, however it would not be very hard to add support for it.
* It is suggested, that in multi-hart systems all Trace Encoders use shared timestamp (for better code correlation), but it is not necessary.
* Timestamp at all cases, when address is provided should be at a time when an event leading to that particular address being sent happened.
** If above is not possible, timestamp should be at least reported in consistent way, so distance between distant events can be reliably calculated. 
** It is needed to assure, that time reported at exceptions/interrupt handlers will be a moment when exception was observed.

=== Alternative Messages

Nexus is permitting some messages to be replaced by other (equivalent or super-set) messages. Table below clarifies what N-Trace is allowing. This can be useful for smaller implementation (as less message types may be generated) but will not complicate decoder.

[[ext_RISC_V]]
== Optional, Optimization Extension to Nexus Standard

N-Trace messages are defined as a strict subset of standard Nexus messages. However in order to provide better compression some optional extensions are defined and must be specifically enabled. Table <<#Details_Control_Parameters>> describes all control bits to enable these optimizations.

=== Sequential Jump Optimization

This optimization must be enabled by <<trTeInstEnSequentialJump>> control bit.

By default, the target of an indirect jump is always considered an uninferable PC discontinuity.
However, if the register that specifies the jump target was loaded with a constant then it can be
considered inferable under some circumstances. The hart must identify jumps with sequentially
inferable targets and provide this information separately to the encoder. The final decision as to
whether to treat the jump as inferable or not must be made by the encoder. Both the constant
load and the jump must be traced in order for the decoder to be able to infer the jump target.

Jump targets that are supplied via

* an *lui* or *c.lui* (a register which contains a constant), or
* an *auipc* (a register which contains a constant offset from the PC).

Such jump targets are classified as sequentially inferable if the pair of instructions are retired
consecutively (i.e. the *auipc*, *lui* or *c.lui* immediately precedes the jump). 

NOTE: The restriction
that the instructions are retired consecutively is necessary in order to minimize the additional
signalling needed between the hart and the encoder, and should have a minimal impact on trace
efficiency as it is anticipated that consecutive execution will be the norm.

=== Implicit Return Optimization

This optimization must be enabled by <<trTeInstEnImplicitReturn>> control bit.

Although a function return is usually an indirect jump, well behaved programs return to the
point in the program from which the function was called using a standard calling convention. For
those programs, it is possible to determine the execution path without being explicitly notified
of the destination address of the return. The implicit return mode can result in very significant
improvements in trace encoder efficiency.

Returns can only be treated as inferable if the associated call has already been reported in an earlier
packet. The encoder must ensure that this is the case. This can be accomplished by utilizing a
counter to keep track of the number of nested calls being traced. The counter increments on calls
and decrements on returns. 

The counter will
not over or underflow, and is reset to 0 whenever a synchronization packet is sent. Returns will be
treated as inferable and will not generate a trace packet if the count is non-zero (i.e. the associated
call was already reported in an earlier packet).

Such a scheme is low cost, and will work as long as programs are "well behaved". The encoder will not be able to check that return address is actually that of the instruction following the associated call. As such, any program that modifies return addresses cannot be traced using this mode with this minimal implementation.

Alternatively, the encoder can maintain a stack of expected return addresses, and only treat a
return as inferable if the actual return address matches the prediction. This is fully robust for all
programs, but is more expensive to implement. In this case, if a return address does not match the
prediction, it must be reported explicitly via a packet. This ensures that the decoder can determine which return is being reported.

As an alternative call stack may not include all addresses, but only keep some LSB part of it and use them to compare if return is matching the call or not. Changes that program making incorrect return will return to address with same LSB portion is slim.

<<TODO>> It would be wise if encoder would be aware which mode of is implemented by hardware.

IMPORTANT: Decoder does not need to know what is actual depth of call stack implemented by encoder but for efficiency reasons it should assume max depth. N-Trace implementation should never implement call stack deeper than 32 levels. Such a deep calls will be most likely 'broken' by other event (like periodic SYNC).

=== Repeated History Optimization

This optimization must be enabled by <<trTeInstEnRepeatedHistory>> control bit.

When a simple loop is executed many times, it either has a conditional branch at the start of a loop (which must be 'taken' to terminate the loop) or has a conditional branch at the end of the loop (which is 'taken' to repeat the loop).
In the first case, the branch is 'not taken' most of the time and 'taken' once at the end. In the second case, the branch is 'taken' most of the time, but 'not taken' at the end of the loop.

Loops in a program (memcpy/strcpy/search …) tend to execute many times and many times flow inside the loop is identical. Instead of sending same history bits many times, repeated patterns can be detected and counted. This is BIG saving! As an example, a memcpy of 4MB buffer using 32-bit transfers will execute at least 1M of branches and trace of 1M of history bits (a lot of trace).

Nexus standard defines <<msg_Repeat_Brach,Repeat Branch>> message. This message will provide a single <<field_BCNT,BCNT>> (Branch Count) field instead of generating many identical <<msg_Direct_Brach,Direct Branch>> messages. But this message cannot be used in <<mode_HTM, HTM mode>> as repeated messages (Direct Branch) do not include the HIST field.

In order to allow generation of repeated history of branches in HTM mode an extra encoding for <<field_RCODE,RCODE>> in <<msg_Resource_Full,Resource Full>> message is added.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* This feature must be specifically enabled by setting the *trTeInstEnBrachPrediction* control bit. See <<N-Trace Specific Trace Controls>> chapter for details.
* It is allowed to generate any sequence of <<msg_Resource_Full,Resource Full>> messages as long as the logically concatenated sequence of (repeated or not ...) HIST bits (excluding MSB stop-bit) is the same.
====

Tracing of such simple, long loops would benefit from generating special messages/fields which provide counters of taken/non-taken branches (in a way similar to <<msg_Repeat_Brach,Repeat Branch>> message)

But this approach will not work with more complex code with a conditional statement (or several of them) inside of a loop.

In such a case, it is desired to detect repeated sequences of branches taken/not-taken and instead generate many HIST fields, generate a message consisting of a pattern and repeat count.

Let's assume that we have a loop, which generates a long sequence of repeated taken/non-taken branches. Trace may generate <<msg_Resource_Full,Resource Full>> messages with the following HIST records:

    Msg#1:
        TCODE=27 (ResourceFull)
        RCODE=0 (HIST record overflow is provided as RDATA)
        RDATA=0b1_01_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101 = 0x55555555
                (stop-bit + pattern 01 repeated 15 times)
    Msg#2:
        TCODE=27 (ResourceFull)
        RCODE=0 (HIST record overflow is provided as RDATA)
        RDATA=0b1_01_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101 = 0x55555555
                (stop-bit + pattern 01 repeated 15 times)
    ...
    Msg#10:
        TCODE=27 (ResourceFull)
        RCODE=0 (HIST record overflow is provided as RDATA)
        RDATA=0b1_01_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101 = 0x55555555
                (stop-bit + pattern 01 repeated 15 times)

Instead of generating many messages with identical HIST record, encoder can detect repeated pattern and generate the following single message:

    Msg#1:
        TCODE=27 (ResourceFull)
        RCODE=2 (HIST record overflow is provided as RDATA and 
                repeat count is provided as HREPEAT field)
        RDATA=0b1_01_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101_0101 = 0x55555555
                (stop-bit + pattern 01 repeated 15 times)
        HREPEAT=10  (Repeat Count=10 instead 10 messages)

NOTE: Above example shows a 2-bit pattern, but using the same technique it can be expanded to any size of pattern. Exact way to detect these patterns is not specified as it does not change encoding of messages.

It is also possible to generate the following, a bit, smaller message:

    Msg#1:
        TCODE=27 (ResourceFull)
        RCODE=2 (HIST record overflow is provided as RDATA and 
                repeat count is provided as HREPEAT field)
        RDATA=0b1_01 = 0x5 (stop-bit + single pattern 01)
        HREPEAT=150 (Repeat Count is bigger, but pattern is smaller)

NOTE: This type of compression (reporting shorter patterns and larger counts) may not be practical as it may save only a little. Trace is compressed a lot already and it really should not matter if we report 150 iterations of a loop in 6 or 7 bytes. Example above is provided to assure that trace encoders must handle this type of trace compression.

== Rules of Generating Messages

*Main Rules*

. Plain linear instructions and direct, PC relative jumps generate no trace.
** These are called inferable instructions, where the next PC can be known from looking at binary code.
. Only branches (conditional), indirect flow transfer instructions and exceptions/interrupts generate trace.
** These are called non-inferable instructions, where the next PC cannot be known by looking at binary code.

*Detailed Rules*

. If tracing was disabled and is restarted, a <<msg_ProgTraceSync,ProgTraceSync>> message is generated.
** This message includes the reason for a start (<<field_SYNC,SYNC>> field) and full address (<<field_FADDR,FADDR>> field).
. Any retired instruction increments <<field_ICNT,I-CNT>> field (+1 or +2).
. The following types of instructions allow trace decoders to know the next PC (nothing else is done for them).
** Plain linear instruction => PC is at the next instruction (+2 or +4).
** Direct (inferable...) jump => PC is jump destination (known from PC and opcode as all jumps are PC relative).
** Not taken branch (in BTM mode) => PC is next instruction (+2 or +4).
. Branch (conditional) instruction is handled as:
** In BTM mode it generates a <<msg_DirectBranch,DirectBranch>> message (only if taken).
** In HTM mode it appends single bit (1=taken or 0=not-taken) into branch history buffer (<<field_HIST,HIST>> field).
. In case the trace is stopped or disabled, <<msg_ProgTraceCorrelation,ProgTraceCorrelation>> message is generated.
** It included reason (<<field_EVCODE,EVCODE>> field) and <<field_ICNT,I-CNT>> and (optional) <<field_HIST,HIST>> field, so the last PC can be calculated. 
. In case generated message includes <<field_ICNT,I-CNT>>/<<field_HIST,HIST>> fields, corresponding value is reset.
** In case I-CNT overflows, <<msg_ResourceFull,ResourceFull>> message (with I-CNT before overflow) and I-CNT is reset.
** In case HIST overflows, <<msg_ResourceFull,ResourceFull>> message (with HIST before overflow) is generated and HIST is reset.

*Extended Rules*

These rules are augmenting the above rules if the corresponding configuration setting is set.

. Call and return instructions maintain call stack and if return is matching a call, no trace is generated.
** This is described in details in <<Implicit Return Optimization>> chapter.
. As RISC-V architecture is only supporting PC relative jumps/calls, indirect jumps/calls are used.
** Such instruction sequences may be detected and in such a case no trace is generated.
. I-CNT field is reset after every (taken or not-taken) direct branch.
** Number between branches is 

=== Pseudo-code of Simple N-Trace Encoder

Code below is simplified part of actual C-code used by reference encoder (in C). It defines two functions:

* NTraceEncoderInit(void) - initialize state of encoder
* NTraceEncoderHandleRetired(uint64_t `addr`, uint32_t `flags`) - handle single retired instruction
** `addr` - address of retired instruction
** `info` - information about instruction (type, size, taken/non-taken)

== N-Trace Decoding Guidelines

To decode N-Trace encoded stream of messages (as any other compressed trace) access to opcodes of instructions which were executed is necessary. This is usually done by providing ELF file of a program being executed, but it can be also read-out from the target. Three types of information is needed:

. Size of each instruction (16-bit or 32-bit).
. Types of all instructions (as reported via 'itype' signal on trace ingress port).
. For direct jumps and branches offset encoded in opcode.

At beginning of trace 'full PC' (<<field_FADDR,F-ADDR>> field) is reported. From that moment decoder must follow the code and update PC according to what is provided in messages.

NOTE: In order to provide partial decoding of big trace, 'full PC' is dropped periodically. Periodic 'full PC' drop is also needed to decode trace from small, wrapped around buffer.

=== Decoding Algorithm Principles

Algorithm to reconstruct complete PC flow from N-Trace messages is very simple:

* Handle <<field_HIST,HIST>> field (if available and not 0x1)
** Analyze code from current PC through inferable jumps (all types) and branches (each branch will 'consume' single bit from *HIST* field).
** At the end (after LSB bit from *HIST* is processed), PC will be after last branch (either taken or not taken).
* Handle <<field_ICNT,I-CNT>> field (if available and not 0x0)
** Analyze code from current PC through inferable jumps (all types) - each encountered branch must be treated as not-taken
** It will reach either non-inferable jump or some other 'event' (like exception, interrupt, trace off, trigger etc.)
* At last step apply <<field_FADDR,F-ADDR>> or <<field_UADDR,U-ADDR>> field value (if available). This will be next PC where analysis of next trace message should start.

[NOTE]
=====
* Phrase `inferable jumps (all types)` includes indirect jumps, which are inferable.
* Some messages may encode ICNT and HIST fields under different names (RDATA/CDATA), but meaning and processing is the same.
* Extra fields like SYNC/B-TYPE only provide extra details, but are NOT essential for decoder to reconstruct PC flow.
=====

=== Decoding trace from multiple harts

* Decoder for specific hart should only look for messages with SRC for that particular hart.

=== Decoding trace of complex systems (Linux etc.)

In case of complex systems, where code consist of several independently build programs and libraries decoder must be aware about different. <<msg_Ownership,Ownership>> message should provide enough context. Decoder must be also aware of assignment of *scontext/hcontext* values for specified programs and processes.

=== Decoding self-modifying or JIT (Just In Time compiled) code

Trace encoder is just encoding stream of instructions passed by ingress port from the hart running it, but decoder must be aware of types of each instructions being executed.
In case of self modifying code (or JIT code), binary image (at moment of execution) must be available to decoder. How this can be done in not in the scope of this specification.

NOTE: This is not specific to N-Trace - every trace system which is compressing execution flow heavily may not handle this case well.

== Additional Material

=== Trace Bandwidth Considerations

* SRC field (if enabled) may change otherwise optimal layout of fields in messages.

=== Validation Considerations

* Resource Full message with ICNT overflow is rare and may not be experienced in normal code. Simplest way to to generate is to have infinite loop and (rare) interrupt handler.
** This loop should increment a register or memory location - this value should correspond to total accumulated ICNT.

=== Potential Future Enhancements

Table below is proposing some future enhancements for Nexus compatible (N-Trace) messages. These were discussed during development of N-Trace standard.

[#Future Enhancements]
.Future Enhancements
[cols="25%,15%,60%",options="header",]
|====
|Enhancement|Conformance|Notes
|Instrumentation Data Trace|Nexus Compatible|Very likely (Nexus defines appropriate messages). It will require software to be instrumented by code sending data using trace infrastructure (Arm CoreSight ITM enabled many use-cases).
|Selective Data Trace|Nexus Compatible|Very likely (Nexus defines appropriate messages). It will allow sending some data in response to triggers (from debug module or external).
|Full Data Trace|Nexus Compatible|Likely (E-Trace supports it), but necessary bandwidth may be a problem.
|Smaller field sizes|Nexus Extension|Unlikely (too much of a change). Some of fields may be made shorter (as not all cases are needed), but it may not be justified.
|System Bus Trace|Nexus Compatible|Likely (Nexus defines appropriate messages and there is a need for more than trace of harts).
|Additional TCODE|Nexus Extension|Possible, but more real-life examples are needed to justify it.
|Single MSEO bit|Nexus Compatible|Unlikely to be considered. It may provide (12.5% instead 25% MSEO overhead), but it is more complex to handle by both encoder and decoders.
|More MDO bits|Nexus Compatible|Very unlikely to be considered. In order to keep byte alignment, 14 or 22 or 30-bit MDO may be considered. Even 14-bit will cause a lot of 'wasted' bits.
|====

NOTE: Each of these enhancement should be prototyped and validated using reference C encoder/decoder.
