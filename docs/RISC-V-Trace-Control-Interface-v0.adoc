= Introduction

This document presents a control interface for Nexus Trace Encoder.

Instruction Trace is a system that collects a history of processor execution, along with other events. The trace system is set up and controlled using a register-based interface. Core execution activity appears on the Ingress Port and feeds into a Trace Encoder where it is compressed and formatted into trace messages. The Trace Encoder transmits trace messages to a Trace Sink. In multi-core systems, each core has its own Trace Encoder, and typically all will connect to a Trace Funnel that aggregates trace data from multiple sources and sends the data to a single destination.

This specification does not define the hardware interconnection between the core and Trace Encoder, as this is defined in the _RISC-V Processor Trace Specification_. This document also does not define the hardware interconnection between the Trace Encoder and Trace Funnel, or between the Trace Encoder/Funnel and Trace Sink since it is expected that these components are all part of a system provided by a single vendor.

This specification allows a wide range of implementations including low-gate-count minimal instruction trace and systems with only instrumentation trace. Implementation choices include whether to support branch trace, data trace, instrumentation trace, timestamps, external triggers, various trace sink types, and various optimization tradeoffs between gate count, features, and bandwidth requirements.

= Glossary

*Trace Encoder* - Hardware module that accepts execution information from a core and generates a stream of trace messages/packets.

*Trace Message/Packet* - Depending on protocol different names can be used, but it means the same. It is considered as continous sequence of (usully bytes) describing program and/or data flow.

*Trace Funnel* - Hardware module that combines trace streams from multiple Trace Encoders into a single output stream.

*Trace Sink* - Hardware module that accepts a stream of trace messages and records them in memory or forwards them onward in some format.

*Trace Decoder* - Software program that takes a recorded trace (from Trace Sink) and produces readable execution history.

*WARL* - Write any, read legal. If a non-legal value is written, the writen value must be ignored and register will keep previous, legal value. Used by debugger to determine system capabilities. See Discovery chapter.

*ATB* - Advanced Trace Bus, a protocol described in ARM document IHI0032B.

*PIB* - Pin Interface Block, a parallel or serial off-chip trace port feeding into a trace probe.

= Control Interface

The Trace Encoder control interface consists of a set of 32-bit registers occupying up to a 4K-byte space. The control interface is used to set up and control a trace session, retrieve collected trace history, and control any trace system components embedded in or directly connected to a Trace Encoder.

The Trace Encoder control registers would typically be accessed by a debugger through the debug module. The Trace Encoder may or may not also be accessible through loads and stores performed by one or more harts in the system. Typically, the Trace Encoder connects to the system bus as a peripheral device, but it may use a dedicated bus connection from the Debug Module, or could attach to the DMI bus defined in the RISC-V Debug Specification.

Additional control path(s) may also be implemented, such as a dedicated debug bus or message-passing network.

Mapping the control interface into physical memory accessible from a hart allows that hart to manage a trace session independently from an external debugger. A hart may act as an internal debugger or may act in cooperation with an external debugger. Two possible use models are collecting crash information in the field and modifying trace collection parameters during execution. If a system has physical memory protection (PMP), a range can be configured to restrict access to the trace system from hart(s).

There is typically one Trace Encoder per core. A core with multiple harts (i.e., multi-threaded) will generate messages with a field indicating which hart is responsible for that message. Cores capable of retiring more than one instruction per cycle are typically accommodated with a single Trace Encoder, though this is not required.

The Trace Funnel is a variant of the Trace Encoder and shares many of the same control registers. Each Trace Encoder and the Trace Funnel has its own set of control registers in its own register block.

== Control Interface Versions

Fields in trace control interface are assuming field teImpl.teVersion to be 0.

*Version 0:* Compatible with original SiFive proposal and initial SiFive Nexus implementation.

* Some registers/fields got renamed for clarity and uniformity

== Register Map

The 4K block occupied by a Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel is divided into eight sections of 256 bytes. Section 0 is required and is used for local control registers. Other sections are used for control registers of trace components that are conceptually separate, even if they are physically part of the Trace Encoder/Funnel. Examples of possible subcomponents are:

* PC Sampling
* Filtering
* Instrumented Trace
* Additional Sink Types

Registers in the 4K range that are not implemented read as 0 and ignore writes.

= Trace Encoder Introduction

This section briefly describes features of the Trace Encoder (TE) as background for understanding some of the control interface register fields.

== Trace Encoder Types

By monitoring the Ingress Port, the TE determines when a program flow discontinuity has occurred and whether the discontinuity is inferable or non-inferable. An inferable discontinuity is one for which the Trace Decoder can statically determine the destination, such as a direct branch instruction in which the destination or offset is included in the opcode. Non-inferable discontinuities include all other types as interrupt, exception, and indirect jump instructions.

== Branch Trace Messaging

Branch Trace Messaging is the simplest form of instruction trace. Each program counter discontinuity results in one trace message, either a Direct or Indirect Branch Message. Linear instructions (or sequences of linear instrucions) do not result in any trace messages/packets.

Indirect Branch Messages normally contain a compressed address to reduce bandwidth. The TE emits a Branch With Sync Message containing the complete instruction address under certain conditions. This message type is a variant of the Direct or Indirect Branch Message and includes a full address and a field indicating the reason for the Sync.

== Branch History Messaging

Nexus standard define systems of messages intended to improve compression by reporting only whether conditional branches are taken by encoding each branch outcome is encoded in single bit. The destinations of non-inferable jumps and calls are reported as compressed addresses. Much better compression can be achieved, but an Encoder implementation will typically require more hardware.

== Other Optimizations

Several other optimizations are possible to improve trace compression. These are optional for any Trace Encoder and there should be a way to disable optimizations in case the trace system is used with code that does not follow recommended API rules. Examples of optimizations are a Return-address stack, Branch repetition, Statically-inferable jump, and Branch prediction.

== Trace Sinks

The Trace Encoder transmits completed messages to a Trace Sink. This specification defines a number of different sink types, all optional, and allows an implementation to define other sink types. A Trace Encoder must have at least one sink attached to it.

NOTE: Trace messages/packets are sequences of bytes. In case of wider sink width, some padding/idle bytes (or additional formatting) may be added by particular sink. Nexus format allows any number of idle bytes between messages.

=== SRAM Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words (usually bytes). These are then stored in a RAM, typically located on-chip, in a circular-buffer fashion. When the RAM has filled, the TE may optionally allow trace to be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace.

=== PIB Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to the PIB Sink. Each message is transmitted off-chip (as sequence of bytes) using a specific protocol described later.

=== System Memory (SBA) Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words. These are then stored in a range of system memory reserved for trace using a DMA-type bus master in a circular-buffer fashion. When the memory range has been filled, the TE may optionally allow trace to be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace. This type of sink may also be used to transmit trace off-chip through, for example, a PCIe or USB port.

=== ATB Sink

The ATB Sink transmits bytes of trace messages as an ATB bus master.

ATB has width, which is either 8 or 32-bit what will well match 'packet=sequence-of-bytes' definition.

=== Funnel Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to a Trace Funnel. The Funnel aggregates trace from each of its inputs and sends the combined trace stream to its designated Trace Sink, which is one or more of the sink types above.

NOTE: It is assumed, that each input to funnel (trace encoder or another funnel) has unique 'SRC' field defined (this is teSrcID field in teControl register).

= Trace Encoder Control Interface

Many features of the Trace Encoder are optional. In most cases, optional features are enabled using a WARL (write any, read legal) register field. A debugger can determine if an optional feature is present by writing to the register field and reading back the result.

= Timestamp Unit

Timestamp is an optional feature. An implementation may choose from several types of timestamp unit: Internal, External, Slave, or Vendor-specific. Implementations may have no timestamp, one timestamp type, or more than one type. The WARL field tsType is used to determine the system capability and to set the desired type.

* Internal uses a fixed system clock to increment the timestamp counter
* Slave mode accepts a timestamp broadcast from another Trace Encoder
* External accepts a binary timestamp value from an outside source such as ARM CoreSight(TM) trace
* The width of the timestamp is implementation-dependent

An Internal Timestamp Unit may include a prescale divider, which can extend the range of a narrower timestamp and uses less power but has less resolution.

In a single-hart system with an Internal Timestamp counter, it may be desirable to stop the counter when the hart is halted by a debugger. An optional control bit is provided for this purpose. Most other control bits are also optional. A debugger may determine the specific capabilities by writing and reading back a WARL register field.

= External Triggers

The TE may be configured with up to 8 external trigger inputs for controlling trace. These are in addition to the external triggers present in the Debug Module when Halt Groups are implemented. The specific hardware signals comprising an external trigger are implementation-dependent.

External Trigger Outputs may also be present. A trigger out may be generated by trace starting, trace stopping, a watchpoint, or by other system-specific events.

= Core Watchpoints

Watchpoints are signals from the core that a breakpoint was hit, but the action associated with that breakpoint is a trace-related action. Action identifiers 2-5 are reserved for trace actions in the RISC-V Debug Spec, where breakpoints are defined. Actions 2-4 are defined by the RISC-V Processor Trace Spec. The desired action is written to the action field of the mcontrol CSR (0x7a1). Not all cores support trace actions; the debugger should read back mcontrol after setting one of these actions to verify that the option exists.

If there are vendor-specific features that require control, the wpControl register is used.

It is implementation-dependent what happens when watchpoints or external triggers with conflicting actions occur simultaneously or if watchpoints or external triggers occur too frequently to process.

= Trace Funnel

The Trace Funnel combines messages from multiple sources into a single trace stream. The Funnel has the same options for sinks as a single Trace Encoder which are controlled by the same registers as described above. It is implementation-dependent how many incoming messages are accepted per cycle and in what order.

NOTE: Fields in 'tfControl' registers are sub-sets of fields in 'teControl' register.

NOTE: FUTURE: Funnel should be extended to see what TE[s] or other funnels are connected to particular funnel (read-only bit in TE register connected to bit settable in TF register)

= PIB Trace Sink

Trace data may be sent to chip pins through an interface called the Pin Interface Block (PIB). This interface typically operates at a few hundred MHz and can sometimes be higher with careful constraints and board layout or by using LVDS or other high-speed signal protocol. PIB may consist of just one signal and in this configuration may be called SWT (Serial-Wire Trace). Alternative configurations include a trace reference clock and  1/2/4/8 parallel trace data signals timed to that reference. WARL register fields are used to determine specific PIB capabilities.

The modes and behavior described here are intended to be compatible with trace probes available in the market.

Additional rules:

* Nexus messages are always transmitted with LSB bits first.
* MSEO is transmitted on LSB part and bit#0 first.
* Idle state must be transmitted as all MSEO and MDO bits = 1.

NOTE: Above rules allow receiving probe to skip idle messages.

== Calibration Mode

In optional calibration mode, the PIB transmits a repeating pattern. Probes can use this to automatically tune input delays due to skew on different PIB signal lines and to adjust to the transmitter's data rate (pibContro.pibDivider and pibControl.pibRefCenter). The suggested patterns for each mode are listed here.

== SWT Manchester Protocol

In this mode, the PIB outputs complete trace messages encapsulated between a start bit and a stop bit. Each bit period is divided into 2 phases and the sequential values of the tdata[0] pin during those 2 phases denote the bit value. Bits of the message are transmitted LSB first. The idle state of tdata[0] is low in this mode.

== SWT UART Protocol

In UART protocol, the PIB outputs bytes of a trace message encapsulated in a 10-bit packet consisting of a low start bit, 8 data bits, LSB first, and a high stop bit. Another packet may begin immediately following the stop bit or there may be an idle period between packets. When no data is being sent, tdata[0] is high in this mode.

== PIB Parallel Protocol

Traditionally, off-chip trace has used this protocol. There are a number of parallel data signals and one continuously-running clock reference. The data rate of several parallel signals can be much higher than either of the serial-wire protocols.

As with SWT modes, this protocol is oriented to full trace messages rather than fixed-width trace words. The idle state of tdata is all-ones for Nexus trace and (TBD) for RISC-V Processor Trace. When a message start is detected, this sample and possibly the next few (depending on the width of tdata) are collected until a complete byte has been received. Bytes are transmitted LSB first, with tdata[0] representing the LSB in each beat of data. The receiver continues collecting bytes until a complete message has been received. The criteria for this depends on the trace format. For Nexus, the last byte of a message is one that has mseo=1,1. For E-Trace, the header byte may include a byte count. After the last byte of a message, the data signals may then go their idle state or a new message may begin in the next bit period.

The clock reference, tref, normally has edges coincident with the tdata edges. Typically, a trace probe will use a PLL to recover a sampling clock that is twice the frequency of tref and shifted 90 degrees so that its rising edges occur near the center of each bit period. If the PIB implementation supports it, the debugger can set pibRefCenter to change the timing of tref so that there is a tref edge at the center of each bit period on tdata. Note that this option cuts the data rate in half relative to normal parallel mode and still requires the probe to sample tdata on both edges of tref.

This example shows 8-bit parallel mode with pibRefCenter=0 transmitting a 5-byte message followed by a 2-byte message.

And an example showing 8-bit parallel mode transmitting a 4-byte packet with pibRefCenter=1.

= ATB Trace Sink

Some SoCs may have an Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) infrastructure to manage trace produced by other components. In such systems, it is feasible to route RISC-V trace output to the ATB through an ATB Trace Sink. This module manages the interface to ATB, generating ATB trace records that encapsulate RISC-V trace produced by the TE. There is a control register that includes trace on/off control and a field allowing software to set the DeviceID to be used on the ATB. This DeviceID allows software to extract RISC-V trace from the combined trace. This interface is compatible with AMBA 4 ATB v1.1.

= Reset and Discovery

This chapter describes what trace tool should to to discover 

There are several (independent) reset bits defined by this specification

* teActive - reset for TE block (this will disable encoder from single core)

* pibActive - reset for PIB block (resets Probe Interface Block only)

* atbAcitive - resets ATB Sink Block (resets ATB Sink Interface)

All reset bits should (when kept low) reset most of other fields/bits to defined reset values.

Releasing component from reset may take time - debug tool should monitor (with reasonable timeout) if appropriate bit should changed from 0 to 1. Other fields/bits should remain unchanged (as were set during reset).

NOTE: Some of reset values are defined as 'SD' (system dependent) and these values should reset as well and each time to same value as would be after power-up.

NOTE: Some bigger registers (holding RAM addresseses) may not reset - debugger is expected to write to them before enabling trace. These registers have 'Undef' in reset field. It should not prevent some implementations to reset these.

When component is in reset (single 'active' bit = 0), all control bits (and most registers) should reset. 

Discovery should be performned as follows:

* Reset particular component and capture default values of all registers.
* Release from reset (waiting for acknowledge).
* Set (interesting) WARL fields and read-back values.

= Enabling and Disabling

Enabling should work as follows:

* Release TE from reset and wait for confirmation (teActive=1)
* Set desired mode and verify if that mode is set (regardless of discovery results)
* Enable sink and verify all settings
** For RAM sink, setup addresses (if possible and desired)
* Release PIB from reset and calibrate PIB (if possible and desired)
* Enable PIB capture in appropriate mode (and verify if particular mode is set)
* Enable physical capture (probe dependent)
* Start core (core could be already running as well)
* Periodically read 'teControl' for status of trace (as it may stop by itself due to triggers)

NOTE: Discovery may not be necessary to enable and test trace during development of SoC. However discovery must be possible and should be tested by SoC designer - this is necessary for trace tools to work with that SoC without any customization.

NOTE: Trace tool may verify particular setting once per session, so subsequent starts of trace may be faster.

Disabling trace (captured via PIB) should work as follows:

* Stop TE (teTracing = 0)
* Wait for TE to flush all trace (teEmpty = 1)
* Stop PIB (pibEnable = 0)
* Stop physical capture (probe dependent)

Decoding trace

* Decoder (in most cases) must have an access to code which is running on device either by reading it from device or from file containg it (binary/hex/srec/ELF)
* Trace can be read and decoded while trace is captured
* There is no guarantee that last trace packet is completed until trace is properly flushed and disabled
