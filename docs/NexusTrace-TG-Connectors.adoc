== Rationale
. Nexus standard does not define any small connectors with focus on trace.Here these are :
.. S26x	1 - 104068 - 2	Low performance - 1 MDO signal
.. S40x1	104549 - 6	Low performance - 6 MDO signals(labelled as “not recommended”)
.. S50x	104549 - 7	Low performance - 8 MDO signals

As you see smallest one with reasonable trace has 50 pins.

There is a lot of hardware trace probes, which are being used for debugging and tracing of Arm cores. Arm defines two standard connectors for trace:

. Based on MIPI 20-pin connector (MIPI does not provide that exact pinout) – this is for medium performance trace (4-bit, 100 + MHz double edge captures, max trace bandwidth 800Mbps).
. Based on Mictor 38-pin connector (also defined by MIPI) – this is for high - performance trace (16-bit, up to 400MHz double edge, max trace bandwidth 12.8Gbps).

MIPI Defines debug and trace connectors and this specification is based on these recommendations:

== MIPI20 Connector
This connector is an extension of MIPI10 connector as defined by RISC - V Debug Specification (link TBD)
It adds 4-bit parallel trace, serial trace and some other alternative functions.

|Pin# | Pin Name	        |Explanation
| 1 | VREF DEBUG	        |Reference voltage for all other pin and signals.
| 2 | TMS/TMSC	                |JTAG TMS signal or cJTAG TMSC
| 4 | TCK/TCKC	                |JTAG TCK signal or cJTAG TMSC
| 6 | TDO/SerialTrace	        |Either TDO or SerialTrace(available in case cJTAG is used)
| 7 | GND or KEY	        |May be removed pin(to prevent wrong insertion for non-shrouded connectors and cable with plug in pin#7).In case pin is not removed, it should be GND on target side.
| 8 | TDI	                |JTAG TDI signal
| 9 | GNDDetect	                |Must be GND on the probe. On-board debug circuitry can use this pin to disable itself when external debug probe is connected. If not used for that purpose should be GND on target side.
| 10 | nRESET/nTRST	        |nRESET is primary function.For some targets it may be used as nTRST (connecting both together is not recommended as it may not be possible to halt processor after hardware reset).
| 11 | GND/TgtPwr+Cap	        |Usually GND - see below for detailed explanation of GND/TgtPwr+Cap
| 12 | TraceClk	                |Parallel trace clock (from target to probe)
| 13 | GND/TgtPwr+Cap	        |Usually GND - see below for detailed explanation of GND/TgtPwr+Cap
| 14 | TraceData[0]/SerialTrace	|Either parallel trace or SerialTtrace.
| 16 | TraceData[1]/nTRST	|In case nRESET and nTRST is desired, this pin can used. NOTE: Still 1-bit  parallel or serial trace is possible.
| 18 | TraceData[2]/TriggerIn	|Either trace signal or input trigger (from probe to target).
| 20 | TraceData[3]/TriggerOut	|Either trace signal or output trigger (from target to probe).

=== Explanation for GND/TrgPwr+Cap pins

TODO: Emphasisis what ‘Cap’ is for (it is not obvious)

=== Possible use of TDI/TDO and TriggerIn/Out for application UART

Some debug probles may allow definition of pin functions and may serve as virtual UART terminal for the target. It is often needed for testing and production and having both debug and UART on single connector is desired.

== Mictor 38 - bit Connector

It has all signals from MIPI20 connectors + more triggers and 16-bit trace.
